This repository contains a responsive watches website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features smooth scrolling in each section and includes both a dark and light mode.

To run the website locally, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server. If you have Python installed, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

This will start a local HTTP server on port 8000. You can then view the website by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.
